		"sections": [
			{
				"title": "Project Preparation",
				"items": [
					{
						"question": "What materials do I need to provide?",
						"answer": "At minimum, you'll need Figma design files (or link) and a PRD (product requirements document). Without finalized designs, I won't be able to start work. API documentation and brand guidelines are helpful if available."
					},
					{
						"question": "Can you work without designs?",
						"answer": "I specialize in design implementation, so finalized designs are required. If you don't have designs yet, please work with a designer first and reach out when ready. I can recommend designers if needed."
					},
					{
						"question": "What design formats do you support?",
						"answer": "Figma is strongly preferred. I can also work with Sketch and Adobe XD files, but Figma allows for the most efficient workflow. PSD or image files alone won't allow for accurate implementation."
					},
					{
						"question": "How detailed should the PRD be?",
						"answer": "The more detailed, the better. Include all interactions, state changes, and error handling. Any unclear areas will require clarification before development, which may delay the timeline."
					},
					{
						"question": "How do you calculate quotes?",
						"answer": "Quotes are based on design complexity, number of pages, interaction requirements, and feature specifications. I provide accurate quotes after reviewing your Figma and PRD. Landing pages start at $1,500, web apps at $5,000."
					}
				]
			},
			{
				"title": "Development Process",
				"items": [
					{
						"question": "What technologies do you use?",
						"answer": "I primarily use React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I'll recommend the optimal tech stack based on your project requirements."
					},
					{
						"question": "Is responsive included by default?",
						"answer": "Yes, all projects include responsive implementation. However, your designs must include mobile/tablet versions. Desktop-only designs will limit responsive implementation."
					},
					{
						"question": "What if the implementation differs from the design?",
						"answer": "I aim for pixel-perfect implementation. If you spot any deviations during weekly demos, flag them immediately. Revisions within the original design scope are included at no extra cost."
					},
					{
						"question": "Can I change designs during development?",
						"answer": "Design changes after development starts will incur additional costs and timeline delays. I strongly recommend finalizing designs before starting development."
					},
					{
						"question": "Do you handle deployment?",
						"answer": "Yes, I deploy to your preferred environment — Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc. Hosting setup and domain configuration assistance is included."
