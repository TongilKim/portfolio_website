# Plan 05-01: Add Routing Infrastructure and Create FAQ Page

## Overview

Add React Router to the single-page app to enable separate pages, then create the FAQ page as the first new page.

## Why This Matters

The site is currently a SPA with section-based navigation. To add dedicated FAQ, Process, and About pages, we first need routing infrastructure. Starting with FAQ because it's the most straightforward to implement.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1**: Install react-router-dom
  - Run `pnpm add react-router-dom`
  - Files: `package.json`

- [ ] **Task 2**: Create pages directory and Home page
  - Create `/src/pages/Home.tsx` combining current sections (Hero, Services, Portfolio, About, Contact)
  - Files: `src/pages/Home.tsx`

- [ ] **Task 3**: Set up React Router in App.tsx
  - Wrap app with BrowserRouter
  - Create Routes with Home as index route
  - Keep Header/Footer outside routes (persistent)
  - Files: `src/app/App.tsx`

- [ ] **Task 4**: Create FAQ page component
  - Accordion-style expandable questions
  - Both business and technical questions
  - Bilingual content
  - Files: `src/pages/FAQ.tsx`

- [ ] **Task 5**: Add FAQ content to translation files
  - Business questions: pricing, timelines, revisions, payment
  - Technical questions: tech stack, hosting, maintenance, features
  - Files: `src/locales/en/translation.json`, `src/locales/ko/translation.json`

- [ ] **Task 6**: Update Header with navigation to new pages
  - Add FAQ link to navigation
  - Mix of scroll-to-section (home page) and page navigation
  - Files: `src/app/components/Header.tsx`

- [ ] **Task 7**: Test and verify build
  - Verify routing works
  - Verify FAQ page displays correctly
  - Verify translations work
  - Run build
  - Files: None (testing)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] react-router-dom installed
- [ ] Routes configured with Home and FAQ pages
- [ ] FAQ page with accordion-style questions
- [ ] Both business and technical questions covered
- [ ] All content bilingual (EN/KO)
- [ ] Navigation updated with FAQ link
- [ ] Build passes with no errors

## Dependencies

- Phase 4 complete

## Technical Notes

**Router setup pattern:**
```typescript
<BrowserRouter>
  <Header />
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/faq" element={<FAQ />} />
  </Routes>
  <Footer />
</BrowserRouter>
```

**FAQ accordion with Radix UI:**
Use existing Radix Accordion component or create simple toggle state.

**Navigation update:**
Keep section scroll for home page elements, add Link for FAQ.

## Estimated Scope

Medium - Adds routing infrastructure (one-time setup) plus first new page with bilingual content.
