# Phase 5: Additional Pages - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

## How This Should Work

An information hub that gives visitors everything they need to make a decision about working with you. Three separate pages — FAQ, Process, and enhanced About — that comprehensively answer questions and set expectations.

The FAQ covers both business questions (pricing, timelines, revisions) and technical questions (tech stack, hosting, can you do X). Visitors shouldn't have unanswered questions after reading it.

The Process page shows the step-by-step journey (Discovery → Design → Development → Launch) while also explaining what the client experiences at each stage. Both the professional process AND the client perspective.

The enhanced About page builds on the existing About section, adding more depth to establish credibility and personal connection.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Answer objections** — Every common concern should have a clear answer, removing friction before contact
- **Build confidence** — Visitors should feel "this person knows what they're doing"
- **Set expectations** — Clients know exactly what working with you looks like before reaching out

All three are equally important. These pages are the "convince me" part of the site.

## What's Out of Scope

- Blog/Articles — No content marketing, just static informational pages
- Testimonials/Case studies — Save for a separate phase
- Interactive elements — No calculators, chatbots, or dynamic features
- Keep it simple — Just the core informational pages

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- **Separate pages** — Each topic (FAQ, Process, About) gets its own dedicated page
- **Accordion FAQ** — Expandable questions for clean, organized browsing
- **Visual process** — Icons or illustrations for each process step, not just text walls
- All pages bilingual (English + Korean) like the rest of the site

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This continues the "information hub" approach — comprehensive content that pre-qualifies leads. Visitors who reach out after reading these pages will have clear expectations.

The current site is a single-page app. This phase adds routing and separate pages, which is a notable architectural change from the current section-based navigation.
