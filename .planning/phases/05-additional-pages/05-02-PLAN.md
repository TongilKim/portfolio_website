# Plan 05-02: Create Process/How It Works Page

## Overview

Create a dedicated Process page showing the step-by-step project journey with visual elements, explaining both the professional process and client experience at each stage.

## Why This Matters

Sets clear expectations for potential clients. Showing both the technical process AND what the client experiences builds confidence and pre-qualifies leads.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1**: Create Process page component
  - Visual step-by-step layout with icons
  - Four main phases: Discovery, Design, Development, Launch
  - Each phase shows both "what happens" and "client experience"
  - Files: `src/pages/Process.tsx`

- [ ] **Task 2**: Add Process content to translation files
  - Phase descriptions (Discovery, Design, Development, Launch)
  - Client experience at each stage
  - Timeline expectations
  - Files: `src/locales/en/translation.json`, `src/locales/ko/translation.json`

- [ ] **Task 3**: Add Process route to App.tsx
  - Add /process route
  - Files: `src/app/App.tsx`

- [ ] **Task 4**: Update Header navigation
  - Add Process link
  - Files: `src/app/components/Header.tsx`

- [ ] **Task 5**: Test and verify build
  - Verify Process page displays correctly
  - Verify translations work
  - Run build
  - Files: None (testing)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Process page with visual step-by-step layout
- [ ] Four phases clearly shown (Discovery, Design, Development, Launch)
- [ ] Each phase shows both process and client experience
- [ ] Icons or visual elements for each phase
- [ ] All content bilingual (EN/KO)
- [ ] Navigation updated with Process link
- [ ] Build passes with no errors

## Dependencies

- Plan 05-01 complete (routing infrastructure in place)

## Technical Notes

**Page structure:**
```tsx
<section className="py-20">
  <h1>How I Work</h1>
  <p>From first call to launch...</p>

  <div className="grid">
    {phases.map((phase, i) => (
      <div key={i} className="step">
        <Icon />
        <h2>{phase.title}</h2>
        <p>{phase.description}</p>
        <div className="client-experience">
          <h3>What you'll do:</h3>
          <p>{phase.clientExperience}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
</section>
```

**Visual elements:**
Use Lucide icons for each phase: Search (Discovery), Palette (Design), Code (Development), Rocket (Launch)

## Estimated Scope

Small - Page component with structured content, routing already set up.
