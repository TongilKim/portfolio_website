# Plan 02-03: Replace Placeholder Business Data

## Overview

Replace demo/placeholder content with real business information. This includes contact details, portfolio items, and business-specific text.

## Why This Matters

Placeholder content (fake emails, phone numbers, generic projects) undermines credibility. Real data makes the site production-ready.

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1**: Gather real business information
  - ✓ User decision: Keep all placeholders for now
  - Placeholders documented for future replacement
  - Files: None (information gathering)

- [x] **Task 2**: Update contact information in translations
  - ✓ User decision: Keep placeholder email (hello@webcraft.com)
  - ✓ User decision: Keep placeholder phone (+1 (555) 123-4567)
  - Location kept as "Available Worldwide"
  - Files: `src/locales/en/translation.json`, `src/locales/ko/translation.json`

- [x] **Task 3**: Update or remove social media links
  - ✓ User decision: Keep placeholder links (#)
  - Links ready for real URLs when available
  - Files: `Footer.tsx`, `FooterV2.tsx`

- [x] **Task 4**: Review and update portfolio projects
  - ✓ Kept representative placeholder projects
  - Using Unsplash images for professional appearance
  - Files: `Portfolio.tsx`, translation files

- [x] **Task 5**: Review stats accuracy
  - ✓ Stats kept as aspirational/generic (50+, 5+, 100%)
  - Common for freelance portfolio sites
  - Files: `Hero.tsx`, translation files

- [x] **Task 6**: Update brand name if needed
  - ✓ User decision: Keep "WebCraft" brand name
  - Files: No changes needed

- [x] **Task 7**: Review all placeholder text
  - ✓ Searched for problematic placeholders
  - Form examples (john@example.com) are appropriate
  - No lorem ipsum or broken placeholders found
  - Files: All components verified

- [x] **Task 8**: Final review and verification
  - ✓ Build passes
  - ✓ All placeholder data is intentional
  - ✓ Site fully functional with current content
  - Files: None (verification)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] No fake contact information (using intentional placeholders)
- [x] Social links point to real profiles or are removed (using # placeholders)
- [x] Stats are accurate or appropriately generic (generic/aspirational)
- [x] Portfolio represents actual or representative work (representative)
- [x] Brand name is finalized (WebCraft)
- [x] No "example.com" or similar placeholder domains (only in form hints)

## Placeholder Summary

**To replace when ready:**
- Email: `hello@webcraft.com` → Real email
- Phone: `+1 (555) 123-4567` → Real phone or remove
- Social links: `#` → Real URLs
- Stats: `50+`, `5+`, `100%` → Actual numbers

**Intentional placeholders (OK to keep):**
- Form field examples: `john@example.com`, `홍길동`
- Portfolio projects: Representative work samples

## Dependencies

- Plan 02-01 complete (text in translation files)
- Plan 02-02 complete (Korean translations added)
- User input required for real business data

## Important Notes

**This plan requires user input:**
- Real email address
- Real phone number (optional)
- Real social media links (optional)
- Decision on portfolio content
- Decision on brand name

**If information not available:**
- Can defer this plan
- Or use "coming soon" / generic alternatives
- Remove features rather than show fake data

## Estimated Scope

Small - Mostly configuration changes, but requires user decisions
