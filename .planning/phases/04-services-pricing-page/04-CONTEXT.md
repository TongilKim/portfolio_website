# Phase 4: Services & Pricing Page - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A minimal, CTA-focused services page that quickly shows visitors what's offered and drives them to request a custom quote. Not overwhelming with details - just enough to build credibility and help visitors self-select if they're a good fit.

The page displays service categories as clean cards with icons. Each card has a brief description explaining who that service is for. All paths lead to the contact form for custom quotes.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Drive quote requests** - Primary goal is getting visitors to submit the contact form
- **Build credibility** - Show enough about services that visitors trust you're legitimate
- **Filter inquiries** - Brief descriptions help visitors self-select before contacting

All three are equally important and should be balanced.

## What's Out of Scope

- No fixed pricing/packages - everything is custom quote based
- Detailed "how we work" process breakdown (that's Phase 5)
- Complex interactive elements - keep it simple

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- **Clean service cards** with icons for visual appeal
- **Service categories by Web Development types:**
  - E-commerce sites
  - Portfolio sites
  - Landing pages
  - Web applications
  - (or similar categorization)
- **Brief descriptions per service** explaining who it's for
- **Prominent CTA** linking to contact form
- **Bilingual support** (English + Korean, matching existing site)

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

User prefers minimal approach over comprehensive detail. The existing contact form from Phase 3 already handles quote requests - this page should funnel visitors there.

The site already has a custom quotes model established (no fixed pricing), so this page reinforces that approach with personalized service messaging.
