# Plan 06-03: Final QA and Cross-Browser Testing

## Summary

Run production build, verify all features work, and perform basic cross-browser compatibility check.

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Production build verification

Run commands:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Verify:
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Preview serves the built site correctly

### Step 2: Feature verification checklist

Test all major features in preview mode:

**Navigation & Routing**
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Navigate to /faq - FAQ page works
- [ ] Navigate to /process - Process page works
- [ ] Navigate to /about - About page works
- [ ] All internal links work (navbar, footer)
- [ ] Browser back/forward buttons work

**Language Switching**
- [ ] Language switcher visible and functional
- [ ] Switch to Korean - all text translates
- [ ] Switch back to English - text reverts
- [ ] Language persists on page navigation

**Contact Form**
- [ ] Form validation shows errors for empty fields
- [ ] Email validation works
- [ ] Form shows loading state on submit
- [ ] Success/error messages display correctly (mocked)

**Responsive Design**
- [ ] Desktop layout (1200px+) displays correctly
- [ ] Tablet layout (768px) displays correctly
- [ ] Mobile layout (375px) displays correctly
- [ ] Mobile menu opens and closes
- [ ] Images resize appropriately

**Images & Performance**
- [ ] Hero image loads immediately
- [ ] Portfolio images lazy load on scroll
- [ ] No broken images
- [ ] Smooth scroll to sections

### Step 3: Cross-browser basic check

Test in available browsers:
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium - primary
- [ ] Firefox - verify CSS compatibility
- [ ] Safari (if available) - verify flexbox/grid

### Step 4: Lighthouse audit

Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools:
- [ ] Performance score noted
- [ ] Accessibility score noted
- [ ] Best Practices score noted
- [ ] SEO score noted

Document any critical issues found.

## Verification

- [ ] All checklist items pass
- [ ] No critical accessibility issues
- [ ] Lighthouse scores acceptable (>70 in each category)
- [ ] Site ready for production deployment
